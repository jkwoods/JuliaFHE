FHE Scheme in Julia for HPC (see FHE-DGHV C++ repo)

Functional-ish structure as opposed to OOP; very fun and cool

Calling Scheme.generate() makes Encrypt, Decrypt, etc functions.

'julia_install.sh' is a script for building and running julia on Summit. Very useful if you are using Summit, possibily useful if you're running on another system with POWER9 processors or similar security protocols, but otherwise probably not worth looking at.
